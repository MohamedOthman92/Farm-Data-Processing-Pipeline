# Farm Data Processing Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a data pipeline for processing farm data, including field data and weather data. The pipeline cleans and prepares the data for further analysis, such as exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing.

## Project Components
The project consists of the following components:

1. **Main Script (`main.py`):** This script serves as the entry point for the project. It orchestrates the data processing pipeline, including loading data, performing data cleaning and preparation, and conducting analysis.

2. **Data Ingestion Module (`data_ingestion.py`):** This module provides functions for ingesting data from SQLite databases and web-based CSV files. It includes functions for creating a database engine connection, executing SQL queries, and reading CSV files from URLs.

3. **Field Data Processor Module (`field_data_processor.py`):** This module defines a class `FieldDataProcessor` for processing field data. It includes methods for ingesting field data from a database, renaming columns, applying corrections, and mapping weather station data.

4. **Weather Data Processor Module (`weather_data_processor.py`):** This module defines a class `WeatherDataProcessor` for processing weather data. It includes methods for mapping weather station data, extracting measurements, processing messages, calculating means, and conducting data processing.

5. **Data Analysis Module (`data_analysis.py`):** This module contains functions for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing. It includes functions for filtering data, performing t-tests, and printing test results.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries are used in this project:
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- sqlalchemy

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the data processing pipeline.
4. Explore the processed data and analysis results generated by the script.
